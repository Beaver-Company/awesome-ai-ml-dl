## Docker container instructions

### Build the docker image

Build a docker image with Jupyter Notebook, JDK 9 (from the AdoptOpenJDK build farm) and set the necessary flags to enable the Graal compiler when running the Java Kernel inside the container.

This script depends on the `JuPyteR-Dockerfile` which contains most of the logic and also executes [install-java-kernel.sh]() towards the end of the process.

```
$ ./buildJuPyteRDockerImage.sh
```

Creates a docker image by the name:

```
REPOSITORY                                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
jupyter-java                              latest              17c1b2f81304        11 minutes ago      628MB
```
The whole build process is under 10 minutes depending on the network bandwidth and available machine resources.

### Run the docker container

Once the image is built, a one-line command helps run it:

```
$ ./runJuPyteRDockerContainer.sh
```

which runs the container and the [runJuPyteRLocal.sh]() is executed inside the container. In theory, [runJuPyteRLocal.sh]() should execute in the local environment, provided the necessary dependencies are installed (as done by the [buildJuPyteRDockerImage.sh]() script).

#### Scripts provided:

- [buildJuPyteRDockerImage.sh](): build the Jupyter-Dockerfile dockerfile
    - [JuPyteR-Dockerfile](): a dockerfile script to help build a docker image of Jupyter with the IJava kernel running on Java 9 (with Graal enabled)
        - [install-java-kernel.sh](): executed during building of the Docker container
- [runJuPyteRDockerContainer.sh](): run the Jupyter docker image, exposing port 8888 to point your browser to (http://localhost:8888)
    - [runJuPyteRLocal.sh](): runs inside the docker container but can be also run on any local environment with the necessary dependencies installed.

Note: the Graal compiler can be enabled starting Java 9 and this currently only works for Linux. But later versions support Linux, MacOS and Windows.

### Debug your running container

Set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `true` and it should do the job:

```
$ DEBUG=true ./runJuPyteRDockerContainer.sh
```

You will be provided with the below prompt:

```
*************************
* Running in Debug mode *
*************************

root@a659f75885b0:/jupyter-notebooks#
```

The `jupyter-notebook` instance will need to be started manually.
